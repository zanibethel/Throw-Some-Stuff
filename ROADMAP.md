# ROADMAP

_Status values: Not started, In progress, Complete. Only mark work Complete after verification._

- **Goal:** Track held items and consumables securely.
- **Deliverable:** Server-authoritative inventory service, item definitions, equip/use flow, and UI hooks.
- **Dependencies:** 1, 2, 3.

## 5. Locked-door and key system
- **Goal:** Unlock progression through secure door state handling.
- **Deliverable:** Door config, key/code validation, door state replication, and reset behavior.
- **Dependencies:** 1, 2, 4.
- **Acceptance criteria:** Doors reject invalid access, accept valid progression items, and reset cleanly between rounds.

## 7. Entity state machine
- **Goal:** Define the backbone for hostile behavior.
- **Deliverable:** Entity states, transitions, tuning config, and lifecycle hooks.
- **Dependencies:** 1, 6.
- **Acceptance criteria:** Entities transition predictably among idle, patrol, alert, pursue, recover, and reset states.
- **Manual Studio tests:** Force each state transition and verify reset safety.
- **Status:** Not started.

## 8. Entity pursuit and capture
- **Goal:** Add live threat pressure and consequences.
- **Deliverable:** Pursuit logic, capture flow, recover states, and team-facing feedback.
- **Dependencies:** 7.
- **Acceptance criteria:** Pursuit and capture are readable, fair, and server-authoritative.
- **Manual Studio tests:** Verify chase start/stop, capture, interrupted pursuit, and multi-player target switching.
- **Status:** Not started.

## 9. Hiding system
- **Goal:** Give players temporary escape options.
- **Deliverable:** Hiding spot logic, occupancy rules, entry/exit flow, and threat interaction tuning.
- **Dependencies:** 2, 7, 8.
- **Acceptance criteria:** Hiding works consistently, prevents invalid occupancy states, and interacts correctly with pursuit rules.
- **Manual Studio tests:** Verify simultaneous hide attempts, forced exits, and resets during occupancy.
- **Status:** Not started.

## 10. Flashlight and temporary stun
- **Goal:** Add tactical tools that shape tension.
- **Deliverable:** Flashlight item, battery or cooldown tuning, stun item behavior, and safe server validation.
- **Dependencies:** 4, 7, 8.
- **Acceptance criteria:** Tools function reliably, replicate correctly, and do not let clients fake threat control.
- **Manual Studio tests:** Verify darkness readability, stun timing, exhaustion, and exploit attempts.
- **Status:** Not started.

## 11. Cooperative puzzle
- **Goal:** Require teamwork without excluding solo play.
- **Deliverable:** Puzzle with scalable rules for one to six players.
- **Dependencies:** 2, 6.
- **Acceptance criteria:** Puzzle scales to active player count, exposes clear feedback, and resets safely.
- **Manual Studio tests:** Verify solo fallback, two-player coordination, and six-player contention.
- **Status:** Not started.

## 12. Round reset and progression
- **Goal:** Make repeated play reliable.
- **Deliverable:** Round manager, reset pipeline, progression handoff, and disconnect-safe recovery.
- **Dependencies:** 1 through 11.
- **Acceptance criteria:** Deaths, disconnects, and round ends restore a clean playable state without duplicate listeners or orphaned instances.
- **Manual Studio tests:** Verify full reset after failure, disconnect during progress, and repeated restart cycles.
